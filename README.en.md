# Possible improvements

## üéÆ GAME MODES

### 1. PvP (two players on one device)
- Two profiles: drop-down list + the ability to create a new one.
- All settings: names, background, language, music, weather, planet, chaos level.
- Tracking matches between players (log in their profiles).
üîß Comment: Fully implementable. It is worth providing confirmation before creating a new profile to avoid garbage.

### 2. Campaign
- One player ‚Üí one profile.
- List of levels (visualized list of buttons).
- Each level sets fixed conditions: planet, weather, difficulty.
- Player progress is recorded in the profile.
üîß Supplement:
- Add a star rating system (1‚Äì3), passing with minimal errors.
- You can introduce scenarios/missions (for example: "shoot three times to win").

### 3. Single battle (with AI)
- One player.
- Manual selection of all settings.
- Based on the selected parameters (gravity, chaos, weather, etc.), the difficulty is assessed: Normal / Hard / Nightmare
üîß Idea: Introduce the calculation of "difficulty points" and display before the start of the game. For example: Difficulty: 4.3/5 (Nightmare)
üìå Criticism: It is necessary to clearly define how the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill shoot (simplified bot? simulation?). You can start with random + minimum zoom.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SETTINGS (universal for all modes)

| Setting | Type | Influence |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Player Name | Text / Profile | Save Progress |
| Planet | List | Changes Gravity |
| Weather | List | Visual and Physical Effects |
| Time of Day | Toggle | Background and Atmosphere |
| Language | Toggle (RU/EN) | Interface Texts |
| Music | List of Themes or Toggle | Background Accompaniment |
| Chaos Level | List (None / Angle / All) | Pseudo-Randomness |

## üß† PROFILES AND SAVES

Format:
.player encrypted or archived .txt or .json
Profile name = file name (e.g. Alex.player)
Inside:

{
"name": "Alex",
"campaign": {"1": "completed", "2": "locked"},
"battles": [{"mode": "PvP", "opponent": "Mira", "result": "win"}],
"settings": {...}
}

üîß Recommendations:
- Store files in a separate folder /profiles/.
- Automatically scan and display profiles on startup.
- Add a garbage filter (e.g. when creating, require name confirmation + at least 3 characters).

## üõ†Ô∏è WEAPONS AND SHELLS

| Weapon type | Parameters | Control mechanics |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Catapult | mass, angle | as is now |
| Cannon | charge, angle | force = press duration |
| Railgun | voltage, induction, angle | several scales or 2D panel |

üîß Idea development:
- Each weapon is unlocked as you progress.
- You can give the player a random/limited weapon in the campaign.
üìå Implementation: You will need an abstract Weapon class, inheritors with get_trajectory().

## ü™ú IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (by stages)

| Stage | Function | Complexity | Dependencies |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| 1 | Add profile support | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | UI + file system |
| 2 | Mode screen: PvP / Campaign / Solo | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | UI transitions |
| 3 | Campaign with levels | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Reading levels, saving |
| 4 | Single-player AI battle | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Basic bot |
| 5 | Weather effects and influence | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Physics and visualization |
| 6 | Chaos level (random) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Randomness generator |
| 7 | Language switcher | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Translation tables |
| 8 | Weapons/shells | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Classes, interface |

## üîç Problems and Prospects
### Strengths:
- Good modular structure of ideas
- Linking functionality to gameplay meaning
- Scaling support

### Potential difficulties:
- The number of saves in a folder can grow quickly ‚Üí either a centralized DB (for example, profiles.json) or automatic cleaning / grouping is needed
- Balancing weapon parameters and randomness is an important issue

## üí° Additional
- Add rewards to campaigns (skins, animations, new levels).
- Support for cheat codes (as a developer option - for testing).
- Multilingual translation with the ability to automatically connect new languages ‚Äã‚Äã(via .lang files).
